<li> <b>Recurrent Interpolation Surfaces</b> <br>

Fractals have been used for decades for creating amazingly
detailed and complex images. In most situations, these
images do not represent any known target shape,
but are simply created for their mathematical intricacy
and beauty. In other cases, fractals have been used to
model the patterns found in marble, the texture of tree bark,
and alien landscapes. The algorithms that generate
these shapes are nondeterministic, meaning that only the general
character of the target shape is specified, whereas the
specific details are controlled somehow through random number
generation. The focus of my research involves constructing
deterministic fractal models that can approximate known target
shapes both in character and in specific detail. Recurrent
Interpolation Surfaces (RIS), a class of fractal surfaces
I have constructed, are appropriate for modeling intricate
terrain data. The surface is defined by a function whose
graph is the attractor of an Iterated Function System (IFS).
This function is constrained to interpolate a known
set of surface elevation values that can be retrieved
from digitial elevation maps of known mountain ranges.
The image below on the left was generated by a program that allows
the user to reposition 25 interpolation points and specify
surface roughness in the neighborhood of each point.
The image on the right is a
"recurrent donut" which interpolates 80 surface points.
Previous solutions based on the IFS model yield
unnatural creases in the surface which are too
objectionable for practical use.

<li> <b>Real time shading of relief surfaces using texture maps</b><br>

I am working with Gunay Uyan, a graduate student working on her Master's
Degree, on a techique for the real-time
rendering of relief carvings such as those found on the walls
of ancient Egyptian tombs. Instead of storing all the complex
geometry necessary to draw these intricate textures, we store
a compressed representation of the surface that allows us
to instantly reshade the surface whenever a light source moves.
This technique can allow archeologists to perform virtual 
"walk-throughs" of ancient sites and can enhance the realism in video
games. The initial images used to create our texture maps
are gathered by repeatedly photographing an object from a fixed position 
while moving a single light source to different positions
on a hemisphere surrounding the object. Once these images are
gathered, we create a compressed representation of these images 
using spherical harmonics. These compressed image are loaded
directly into the memory of the video card which is then
programmed to retexture surfaces in a scene based on the
current lighting situation.

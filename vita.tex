\noindent{\large\bf Research and Technical Interests}\\

{\em Computer Graphics, Geometric Modeling, Rasterization, Real-Time Rendering
and GPU Programming.}
My career in computer graphics started by 
implementing rasterization firmware
for industrial graphics boards based on
TI's TMS34010 line of graphics processors.
Later I developed a 3D rendering system
that used the TMS34082 floating  point coprocessor.
Essentially I was programming GPU's long before
the current wave of GPU coding become popular.
Later, during graduate school, I developed an interest
in a class of fractal models that were used for compressing
images at unusually high bit rates. I extended these
algorithms (along with methods based on the DCT)
to compress 3-D volumetric data produced by CT
and MRI machines. Following this, I developed a variety of methods
based on fractal interpolation functions to model
and render intricate curves and surfaces.
I remain interested in modeling 
complex surfaces and textures with fractals and I am
investigating techniques inspired by
Wang Tiles to generate infinitely detailed structures.
Due to the availability of cheap video hardware,
GPU programming
has now extended beyond the realm of computer graphics.
General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) techniques are also
an interest of mine.
I enjoy programming Apple's mobile devices, the iPad and iPhone,
which utilize embedded GPU's.

\noindent{\large\bf Professional Experience}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Clinical Assistant Professor}, 1999-present,
Washington State University Vancouver.
My original position was on a tenure track, but was later switched
to a clinical position to match teaching interests.
Courses taught at WSUV:
{\em Mobile Application Development, Programming Tools, 
Automata and Formal Languages, 
Numerical Computing,
Programming Language Design,
Operating Systems and Computer Architecture, 
Introduction to Computer Graphics,
Advanced Computer Graphics, Theory of Computation} and {\em Compiler Design.}
I am heavily involved in program development for 
the computer science program which started in the fall of 1999.
Research involves intricate surface and texture
modeling using recurrent models and Wang Tiles.
I also have high interest in OpenGL and GPU programming for both
graphical applications and general purpose parallel computing.

\item {\bf Instructor}, 1998-1999,
Washington State University. I performed research and taught
courses in Introduction to Microprocessors, C Programming,
Windows Programming, Computer Networks, and Java Programming.

\item {\bf Research Assistant}, 1994-1998,
Washington State University.
My research included volumetric compression using fractals,
and other techniques using fractals to model complex geometry
({\it e.g.,} rough curves and surfaces). Research was part of the
{\em Recurrent Modeling Project} funded by Intel and a grant
from the NSF.
%Also acted as substitute teacher for Computer Graphics, 
%Advanced Computer Graphics, and Numerical Computing. 

\item {\bf Research/Teaching Assistant}, 1992--1994, 
Washington State University.
Contributed research for and implementation of knowledge based systems.
Lab instructor for
introductory computer programming courses.
